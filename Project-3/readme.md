Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, 
low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated
with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. 

In this project, I've build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques. I have used the dataset available in UCI Machine learning repository.
