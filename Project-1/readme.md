In this project, I've done a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play 
across different categories to look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

This project was a part of Datacamp's career track "DATA SCIENTIST USING PYTHON".
