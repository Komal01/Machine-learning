This project was a part of Datacamp's career track "DATA SCIENTIST USING PYTHON".
In this project, I've done a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play 
across different categories to look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.


Datasets consists of two files:
 1. apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
 2. user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new           features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
